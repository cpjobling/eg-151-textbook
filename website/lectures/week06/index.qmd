### Topics discussed

In this section we will be looking at how we can read analogue signals into a microcontroller using an analogue to digital converter. The lecture starts by introducing analogue signals  and the fundamental principals of an ADC before moving to look at the ADC contained on the Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller, focussing on the key registers and how to use them. The section concludes with an example program for the Atmel ATmega328 microcontroller which reads the voltage from a potentiometer and turns on some LEDs based on the voltage.

### Analogue signals

Analogue signals are those that are both continuous in time and continuous in amplitude i.e. they are continuous signals.

In the real world, most measurable parameters are actually analogue. They include such signals as temperature, humidity, light, sound, etc. 

An analogue sensor for measuring light intensity is shown in {numref}`ex7:fig:anlogue_sensor` along with a calibration graph that would be typically supplied in the data sheet for such a sensor..

### Sampling and quantization

Since microcontrollers can only handle 0s and 1s (digital signals) we need a way of converting analogue signals to digital signals. This is done using an **analogue-to-digital** converter or ADC.

An ADC converts a **continuous-time** and **continuous-amplitude** analogue signal to a **discrete-time and discrete-amplitude** digital signal through a process called **sampling and quantization** illustrated in {numref}`wk6:fig:sampling`..

### ADC Principles

An analogue signal is continuous in time and amplitude and to convert it to a digital signal it is necessary to **periodically sample the analogue signal**.  The rate at which the signal is sampled is referred to as the **sampling rate**.

Each time the signal is sampled the analogue value must be represented in one of several discrete *bins* (digital values). The number of discrete bins available is called the **resolution**.

Both, the sampling rate and the conversion resolution need to be sufficiently high to create an accurate digital reconstruction of the analogue signal.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### ADC Sampling Rate
The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem implies that to get an accurate reproduction of the original signal, the sampling rate must be higher than twice the highest frequency of the signal. Lower than this and the reproduced signal will be distorted, and data lost.

Note:  This will be covered in more detail in EG-247 Digital Signal Processing in year. 2

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

#### Example.
Consider the sine wave governed by the equation $x(t) = sin(t)$. the period is $2\pi$ (approx. 6.3 seconds) so the frequency is 0.16 Hz ({numref}`wk6:fig:sinewave`).

```{figure} pictures/sinewave.png
:alt: Analogue signal x(t) = sin(t) - a sine wave.
:name: wk6:fig:sinewave

Analogue signal $x(t) = sin(t)$ - a sine wave.
```
`

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

If we sample this at 0.5 Hz (once every 2 seconds), which is over 3 times the original frequency we get the orange trace {numref}`wk6:fig:sampled_wave`. From this it would be enough to accurately recreate the blue trace.

```{figure} pictures/sampled_wave.png
:alt: Sine wave x(t) = sin(t) sampled at 0.5 Hz.
:name: wk6:fig:sampled_wave

Sine wave $x(t) = sin(t)$ sampled at 0.5 Hz.
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### ADC Resolution
As well as the sampling rate, the resolution of the converter is crucial to getting an accurate representation of the input signal. The resolution indicates the number of discrete values that can be used over the total range of analogue values.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

#### A 2 bit ADC
As an example a 2-bit ADC has $2^2 = 4$ quantization levels ({numref}`wk6:fig:2bit`)..

```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

#### Resolution of a 3-bit ADC

To calculate the resolution of an ADC we use {eq}`eq:adc_res`[^floor].

[^floor]: Note the symbols $\lfloor \ldots \rfloor$ are called *floor*. They round a decimal number to the next lowest integer value. That is the decimal part is simply eliminated. Thus quantization is always going to choose the bin that is the closest to the truncated part of the decimal number.

```{math}
:label: eq:adc_res
\mathrm{Digital\ Output} = \left\lfloor\frac{\left(2^N-1\right)\times\mathrm{Analogue\ Input\ Voltage}}{\mathrm{Reference\ Voltage}}\right\rfloor
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

The graph in {numref}`wk6:fig:resolution` shows the values (*bins*) that are available for a three bit ADC.

:alt: The resolution of a 3 bit ADC
:name: wk6:fig:resolution

```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

#### Examples

Let's say that we have a **10-bit ADC** and the reference voltage is **5V**.

If our input is **2.2V** the the digital output will be:

\begin{align}
\mathrm{Digital\ Ouput} &= \left\lfloor \frac{1023 \times 2.2}{5}\right\rfloor \\
&= \lfloor 450.12 \rfloor = 450_{10}\\
&= 10\ 1100\ 0010_2
\end{align}

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

Notice in the first example when the resolution is 10-bit the answer consists of 10 bits not 12 or 16.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

Let's say that we have a **6-bit ADC** and the reference voltage is **3.3**.

If our input is **1V** the the digital output will be:

\begin{align}
\mathrm{Digital\ Ouput} &= \left\lfloor \frac{63 \times 1}{3.3}\right\rfloor \\
&= \lfloor 19.09 \rfloor = 19_{10}\\
&= 01\ 0011_2
\end{align}

#### Illustrating the sampling theorem

##### Violation of the sampling theorem

Consider the signal with frequency $F_c = 1$Hz, sampling frequency of $F_s = 1$Hz, and resolution = 3 bits. The sampled signal is illustrated in {numref}`wk6:fig:violation`. Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem has clearly been violated and the original signal cannot be reconstructed from the sampled signal.

##### Sampling at twice the signal frequency 

Consider the signal with frequency $F_c = 1$Hz, sampling frequency of $F_s = 2$Hz (the so-called Nyquist frequency), and resolution = 3 bits. The sampled signal is illustrated in {numref}`wk6:fig:nyquist`. The reconstructed signal is on the border of acceptable. In practice, we need to sample at a higher frequency than $F_s = 2F_c$.

##### Sampling at five times the signal frequency 

Consider the signal with frequency $F_c = 1$Hz, sampling frequency of $F_s = 5$Hz, and resolution = 3 bits. The sampled signal is illustrated in {numref}`wk6:fig:5fs`. The reconstructed signal (in the bottom trace) is starting to look like a sine wave.

* Voltage Reference
* Digital to Analogue Converted (DAC)

Most general-purpose microcontrollers contain SAR-based architecture ADCs.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### SAR based ADC Architecture

Successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADCs are the most common architecture for medium-to-high-resolution applications with sample rates under 5 megasamples per second.

The SAR converter is essentially a binary search algorithm which compares the input to the ADC with the output from a digital to analogue converter (DAC) until the input matches the DAC output and the device is able to output the corresponding binary value. 

While the internal circuitry of the ADC may be running at several megahertz, the ADC sample rate is a fraction of that number due to the multiple step successive-approximation algorithm needed to convert the measured input to a binary number.

The SAR converter is at the heart of the ATmega328 microcontroller and is highlighted in {numref}`wk6:fig:sar`.

```{figure} pictures/sar_converter.png
:alt: Schematic diagram of the Atmel ATMega328 ADC system with the SAR highlighted.
:name: wk6:fig:sar

Schematic diagram of the Atmel ATMega328 ADC system with the SAR highlighted.
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

#### SAR based ADC Operation
Consider the schemeatic diagram shown in {numref}`wk6:fig:sar_converter`.

```{figure} pictures/sar.png
:alt: Schematic diagram used to illustrate the hardware used to achieve SAR conversion.
:name: wk6:fig:sar_converter

Schematic diagram of the hardware used to achieve SAR conversion (image source: Analog Devices[^sar_conversion]).
```

The analogue input signal is held by a track/hold circuit and fed as $V_\mathrm{IN}$ into a comparator. 

To implement the binary search algorithm, the $N$-bit register is first set to mid-scale (that is the MSB is set to 1 and all other bits set to 0) so that the voltage at $V_\mathrm{DAC} = V_\mathrm{REF}/2$. 

[^sar_conversion]: [Understanding SAR ADCs: Their Architecture and Comparison with Other ADCs](https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/successive-approximation-registers-sar-and-flash-adcs.html), Analog Devices.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

A comparison is then performed to determine if $V_\mathrm{IN} \le  V_\mathrm{DAC}$. 

If $V_\mathrm{IN} >  V_\mathrm{DAC}$, the comparator output will be logic high (or 1), and the MSB of the $N$-bit register remains at 1. 

If $V_\mathrm{IN} <  V_\mathrm{DAC}$, the comparator output is a logic low (0) and the MSB of the $N$-register is cleared to logic 0.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

The SAR control logic then moves to the next bit along[^next_bit_along], forces that bit high, and repeats the comparison. The sequence continues all the way down to the LSB (bit 0). 

[^next_bit_along]: The "next bit along" will be the MSB-$1^\mathrm{th}$ bit. That is, for a 12-bit ADC, MSB is bit 11, and the next bit along will be bit 10. If the previous comparison produced a 1, the binary value we are testing is now $2^{11} + 2^{10} = 2048 + 1024 = 3072$. If the comparison at the previous step was 0, the binary value we are testing is now $2^{10} = 1024$. The corresponding values of $V_\mathrm{DAC}$ will now be either $3072/4096 V_\mathrm{REF} = 0.75 V_\mathrm{REF}$ or $1024/4096 V_\mathrm{REF} = 0.25 V_\mathrm{REF}$. This process continues until all bits have been considered.

Once the input has been compared with the full $N$-bit register the conversion is complete and the $N$-bit digital word is sent to the ADC output register.

Consider {numref}`wk6:fig:sar_example`:

```{figure} pictures/sar_operation.gif
:alt: Example of the successive approximation method in action.
:name: wk6:fig:sar_example

Example of the successive approximation method in action: a 4 bit ADC converting a signal for which $V_\mathrm{IN}$ is in "bin" 5.
```

1. Bit 3 is set high (compare signal is $1000_2$) 
   * $V_\mathrm{IN} < V_\mathrm{DAC}$ so the comparator output is low (0).
2. Bit 3 is set low and bit 2 is set high (compare signal is now $0100_2$). 
  * $V_\mathrm{IN} > V_\mathrm{DAC}$ so the comparator output is high (1).
3. Bit 2 remains high and now Bit 1 is set high too (compare signal is $0110_2$). 
   * $V_\mathrm{IN} < V_\mathrm{DAC}$ so the comparator output is low (0).
4. Bit 1 is set low and bit 0 is set high (compare signal is $0101_2$) 
   * $V_\mathrm{IN} > V_\mathrm{DAC}$ so the comparator output is high (1).

The final output of the conversion is $0101_2 = 5/16 V_\mathrm{REF} = 0.3125 V_\mathrm{REF}$.

##### ADCL and ADCH - The ADC Data Registers

The ADC Data Registers are illustrated in {numref}`wk6:fig:adc_data`.

```{figure} pictures/adc_results.png
:name: wk6:fig:adc_data
:alt: The ADC Data Registers

The ADC Data Registers `ADCH` and `ADCL` when (a) ADLAR = 0 and (b) when ADLAR = 1.
```

When an ADC conversion is complete, the result is put in these two registers[^precision].

[^precision]: Recall that the ADC has a precision of up to 10 bits so two data registers are required. Register `ADCL` contains the least significant 8 bits, bits [0-7] and `ACDH` contains the most significant bits bit 8 and bit 9.

When `ADCL` is read, the ADC Data Register is not updated until `ADCH` is read. 

If the result is left adjusted and no more than 8-bit precision is required, it is sufficient to read `ADCH`. Otherwise, `ADCL` must be read first, then `ADCH`.

##### `DIDR0` - Digital Input Disable Register 0

###### Bits 5:0 - ADC5D...ADC0D: ADC5...0 Digital Input Disable

```{image} pictures/didr0.png
:alt: Register DIDR0 with bits 0-5 highlighted.
```

When logic 1 is written to one of these bits, the digital input buffer on the corresponding ADC pin is disabled. (i.e. the corresponding PIN register bit will always read zero).

When an analog signal is applied to the ADC5...0 pin and the digital input from this pin is not needed, logic 1 should be written to this bit to reduce power consumption in the digital input buffer.

#### Setting up the ADC

The following steps are illustrated in flow-chart form in {numref}`wk6:fig:flc1`.

In words, the operations to be completed are:

1. **Define** convenient **names** for the required registers.
2. Set the **data direction** of the relevant pins to input (`DDRxn`)
3. Set the corresponding pin in the **input disable register** to 1 to disable the input buffer (`DIDR0`)
4. Select the **reference voltage**, **result alignment** and **input channel** (`ADMUX`)
5. Select the **ADC prescaler value** in the A control and status register (`ADCSRA`)
6. Write a **1 to the `ADEN` bit** of the A control and status register to enable the ADC (`ADCSRA`)

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

The **main code** is illustrated in the flowchart shown in {numref}`wk6:fig:flc2`.

```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "notes"}}

In words, the operations to be completed are:

1. Within the infinite for loop, **Write a 1 to the `ADSC` bit** of the A control and status register each time you want to start a conversion (`ADCSRA``) 
2. Monitor for the **`ADSC` bit going low** (or the `ADIF` bit going high) of the A control and status register.
3. Read the converted value from the result registers (`ADCH`  and `ADCL`).
4. Do something with the ADC result.

We illustrate this in {ref}`wk6:sect4`.

## Analogue I/O Example program

### Single Conversion Example 

The centre tap of the blue potentiometer shown in {numref}`wk6:fig:adc_board` is connected to the analogue input `A0` which represents Port C Bit 0 on the ATmega328 microcontroller. 

```{figure} pictures/adc_board.jpg

:name: wk6:fig:adc_board

```

As the voltage at the input changes, the value is reflected on the 6 LEDs
What does the code for this look like without using the predefined Arduino function – `analogRead`?

### Example code - aligning port names to the I/O memory map

We showed how we use the `#define` function to map our program variables to the I/O memory map shown in {ref}`aligin_to_io_mem_map`. We use the same technique to map the digital and analogue registers to programmer friendly names:

```c
//I/O and ADC Register definitions taken from datasheet
#define PORTB  (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x25))
#define DDRB   (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x24))
#define PINB   (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x23))

#define ADMUX  (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x7C))
#define ADCSRA (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x7A))
#define ADCRSB (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x7B))
#define ADCH   (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x79))
#define ADCL   (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x78))
#define DIDR0  (*(volatile uint8_t *)(0x7E))
```

We now define some unsigned integers as either 8  or 16 bits:

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

* Variable type: `uint16_t`

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

* first variable name: `adc_result`

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

* second variable name: `previous_result`

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

* Initial value of `previous_result`: `=0;"

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

The definitions are:

```c
uint16_t adc_result, previous_result = 0;
uint8_t  adc_result_low, adc_result_high;
```

### Example - the main function

We discussed this in {ref}`main_c`.

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Example - set up I/O using the registers

```c
// Set Data Direction Registers
DDRB = DDRB | 0b00111111; // Setup bits 0 - 5 of port B as outputs

// Turn all LEDs off
PORTB = PORTB & 0b11000000; // Pins B0 (D8) - B5 (D13) start low
	
// Set up ADC on pin A0
DIDR0 = DIDR0 | 0b00000001; //Disable pin A0 as a digital input
	
ADMUX = 0b01000000; // Select reference voltage, right adjusted result and select channel ADC0 - A0

ADCSRA = ADCSRA | 0b00000111; // Select ADC Prescaler

ADCSRA = ADCSRA | 0b10000000; // Enable ADC
```

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Example - the processing loop

```c
for(;;)
{
	ADCSRA = ADCSRA | 0b01000000;	      //start conversion by writing 1 to the ADSC bit
		
	while((ADCSRA & 0b01000000) != 0) { } //wait until the ADSC bit changes to 0

	adc_result_low  = ADCL;		//read the low byte of the result into adc_result_low
	adc_result_high = ADCH;		//read the high byte of the result into adc_result_high
    /* shift whole 8 bits of ADC high byte into most significant byte of ADC result and 
       add in ADC low byte using bitwise OR. */
	adc_result = (adc_result_high<<8) | adc_result_low; 

    // do somethinhg interesting with the ADC readings

}
```
