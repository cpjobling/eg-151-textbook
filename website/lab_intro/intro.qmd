# Laboratory Introduction {#sec-lab-intro-intro}

In this laboratory introduction, you will do the following:                                                                                 

- *Experiment*: to construct an oscillator circuit on a plug-in breadboard
- *Simulation exercise*: to investigate the operation of the oscillator circuit using National Instruments Multisim, a circuit simulation package
- *Construction exercise*: to build a continuity tester in a Tic-Tac® box

We expect that you will work through the exercises contained in this practical introduction in less than two weeks (four lab sessions), but a month has been allowed.

You should record your results in your lab diary.

After each significant section, there is an assignment point which you should use to submit your work for grading.

## Table of contents

You should work through each of these activities in order. 

* @sec-labintro-assessment
* @sec-depteee-labwork
* @sec-lab-intro-instruments
* @sec-lab-intro-lab-safety
* [Obtain and Keep a Lab Diary](hhttps://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/52902/pages/to-do-obtain-and-keep-a-lab-diary?module_item_id=2882101) - External Link to Canvas
* @sec-experiment-0
* @sec-simulation-exercise
* @sec-lab-intro-questions
* @sec-construction
* @sec-soldering

If you would prefer a document version of the lab introduction, it is available as a PDF which you are welcome to download and use. 

However, so your progress in the lab can be monitored, you are expected to work through the sections on Canvas.
